# RegEx
Practicing regular expressions
This RegEx practice exercice is based from a tutorial on Youtube. All documents needed were imported from Corey Schafer's channel. 
In this tutorial I learned how to write and match regular expressions, the use of quantifiers, matching urls, etc.
There are different methods such as match (returns that match object with our match), search (matches within the entire string) and flags.Flags change the way the regex engine performs pattern matching.

'Regular expressions are useful in search and replace operations. The typical use case is to look for a sub-string that matches a 
pattern and replace it with something else. Most APIs using regular expressions allow you to reference capture groups from the 
search pattern in the replacement string.'
